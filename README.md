##Goals
If you're reading this, you should have already completed Tutorial 1 of Ray Wenderlich's iOS Apprentice (Beginning iOS Development with Swift 2). By following that tutorial, you were introduced to Swift and UIKit through creating a simple iOS number guessing game. In this extension, you're going to add some complexity to the game by introducing more complicated math, creating additional functions, and building more UI features.
